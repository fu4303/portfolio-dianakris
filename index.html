In 2012, Diana was chosen to be one of the 20 girls for the inaugural Girls Who Code program founded by Reshma Saujani. After eight weeks of being exposed to tech companies and new coding languages, Diana decided to pursue Computer Science as a career. She was runner-up for the 2013 tri-state NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Awards and then became an intern at GILT the Summer of 2013. At GILT she created a phone application with another intern that generated random outfits. March of 2014, She was flown out to San Diego to attend the first Qualcomm Women's Collegiate Conference. The following summer she was hired as a software engineer intern for the QCT-UIM (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies - User Identity Modem) team at Qualcomm. Her three months at Qualcomm consisted of developing test cases to test the Toolkit applications in the modem. Besides her positions at GILT and Qualcomm, Diana assisted in teaching two All Star Code day events. She was also chosen with her Hackathon team to represent the Qualcomm interns and interview Jim Thompson, the Executive VP of Engineering at Qualcomm. In February of 2014, Diana was asked to speak at a CSNYC Education Meetup to discuss ways on bringing more girls into STEM fields. She is very passionate about inspiring young girls and getting them involved in Computer Science. She still continues to tutor kids in CS111 at Rutgers and in June 2014 has been featured in an AP article called "New Push to Get Girls into Computer Sciences."omputer programmer.
